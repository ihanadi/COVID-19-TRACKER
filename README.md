## What have I learned

```

- [numeral](http://numeraljs.com/) A javascript library for formatting and manipulating numbers.
Beautiful and easy to learn and handle. I recommend watching it

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) Simple yet flexible JavaScript charting for designers & developers
I liked the way how it works, there are a lot of branches that can build a nice dynamic chart, 
I looked at a small part and I think I will learn more about it in the coming days.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
There are some difficult turns in learning it, but I think it's good and helps
